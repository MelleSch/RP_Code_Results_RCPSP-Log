# RP_Code_Results_RCPSP-Log
This repository contains the code used to calculate upper bounds to the makespans of RCPSP-Log instances, and the code used to encode the problem instances into WCNF to solve with a MaxSAT solver.
Both directories contain a README file to explain the setup and requirements to be able to run the code.
Aside from code, this repository also contains the results that were acquired by running the code, the output is present in its unprocessed from and is also available in an Excel spreadsheet.
